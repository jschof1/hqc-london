                <p class="text-lg text-ink/80 leading-relaxed">
                  He had worked with other cleaning companies before, but told me plainly:

                  He was clear about what he expected, not just a clean home, but one looked after with care and attention. That stuck with me.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-ink/80 leading-relaxed">
                  We started with a full top-to-bottom clean. From protecting surfaces properly to detailing the kitchen and bathroom, we focused on restoring order and showing him that yes, there is a different standard. His home was left spotless and more importantly, respected.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-ink/80 leading-relaxed">
                  We encountered a small hiccup during one of the early services, but rather than hide it, we resolved it quickly and professionally. Mr. Edwards later told me:

                  Since then, he's become a regular. We now care for his property on a regular basis and he's recommended us to others in his network. That means a lot to us.

                  We got to work immediately cleaning top to bottom, removing multiple bags of rubbish, restoring order, and making the space workable for the incoming tradespeople. Once the clean was complete, we sent her another video walkthrough so she could see the transformation for herself. Her response said it all.

                <p class="text-lg text-ink/80 leading-relaxed">
                  Neylan first came to us through a trusted recommendation. A family friend had spoken highly of our work but she was honest from the start: she'd worked with professional cleaning companies before, and had often been left disappointed.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-ink/80 leading-relaxed">
                  There had been missed details, poor communication, and a sense that care was lacking.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-ink/80 leading-relaxed">
                  So when Neylan booked us, she did so with cautious expectations.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-ink/80 leading-relaxed">
                  We didn't overpromise, we simply listened to what she needed and delivered with quiet consistency. The focus was on care, precision, and restoring confidence through detail.
                </p>
                <p class="text-lg text-ink/80 leading-relaxed">
                  What stood out most to Neylan was something we take pride in, the combination of top-tier cleaning with thoughtful, responsive service.

                  This was his second time booking High Quality Clean, and the reason he came back was simple: he felt the difference in how we clean.

                <p class="text-lg text-ink/80 leading-relaxed">
                  From the very first visit, what stood out was the way we handled his home, especially the bathrooms. Not rushed. Not surface-level. But with care, time, and detail where it mattered.
