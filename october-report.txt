## Optimization Actions I'm Implementing

### Week 1: Homepage Conversion Enhancement

**What I'm doing:**
- Refining the hero section to make the value proposition instantly clear
- Strengthening calls-to-action with more prominent placement
- Adding trust signals (insurance coverage, testimonials, credentials) above the fold
- Testing different headline variations to reduce the 85.77% bounce rate

**Expected Impact:** Reduce bounce rate by 15-20 percentage points, increase quote requests by 25%

---

### Week 2: Mobile Experience Overhaul

**Current State:** Only 92 of 747 visitors (12.3%) are on mobile devices

**What I'm doing:**
- Comprehensive mobile UX audit and improvements

**Expected Impact:** Unlock 30-40% more traffic from busy professionals who browse during commutes

**Focus Pages:** Services (41 views), Case Studies (21 views), Contact (21 views)

**What I'm doing:**
- Creating clear pathways between related pages
- Adding "Next Steps" sections to guide visitors toward booking

- Building dedicated landing pages for high-intent searches ("premium cleaning Knightsbridge", "Airbnb cleaning Chelsea")

**Expected Impact:** Increase quote request rate from service pages by 35%

---

### Week 3: Analytics & Tracking Enhancement

**Current Gap:** No event tracking is currently set up

**What I'm implementing:**
- Google Analytics 4 event tracking for:
  - Form submissions
  - Button clicks (all CTAs)
  - Phone number taps
  - WhatsApp message initiations
  - Quote calculator interactions
- Meta Pixel for future Instagram/TikTok campaign optimization

**Current Issue:** 310 Singapore visitors (41% of traffic) skewing data

**What I'm doing:**
- Setting up geographic filters to focus analytics on UK traffic
- Creating region-specific performance reports
- Implementing IP filtering to remove bot traffic
- Building location-based landing pages for target areas (Mayfair, Knightsbridge, Holland Park, Wimbledon)

**Expected Impact:** Clearer data showing actual UK client behaviour, better local SEO performance

---

### Ongoing: Traffic Spike Analysis & Replication

**Notable Pattern:** October 16th generated 901 pageviews and 65 sessions

**What I'm investigating:**
- What drove the October 8th, 16th, and 21st traffic spikes?
- Can we identify the source (social posts, referrals, PR) and replicate it?
- Setting up alerts to catch and analyze future traffic spikes in real-time

**Expected Impact:** Understanding what drives your best traffic days so we can create more of them
