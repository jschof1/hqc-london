            <ContentBlock text="He was clear about what he expected, not just a clean home, but one looked after with care and attention. That stuck with me." />
            <ContentBlock text="We started with a full top-to-bottom clean. From protecting surfaces properly to detailing the kitchen and bathroom, we focused on restoring order and showing him that yes, there is a different standard. His home was left spotless and more importantly, respected." />
            <ContentBlock text="We encountered a small hiccup during one of the early services, but rather than hide it, we resolved it quickly and professionally. Mr. Edwards later told me:" />
            <QuoteBlock text="It wasn't just the clean. It was how you handled the whole situation that made me trust you." />
            <ContentBlock text="Since then, he's become a regular. We now care for his property on a regular basis and he's recommended us to others in his network. That means a lot to us." />

            <ContentBlock text="Mrs. Dean contacted us about her flat in Chelsea, she was planning renovation works and needed the space cleaned ahead of the builders arriving. She wasn't based in London, but she knew the property needed attention and wanted a professional clean to prepare the space." />
            <ContentBlock text="When we visited the flat for an initial inspection, it became clear the condition was worse than expected. We filmed a full walkthrough and sent her a video report. She was shocked." />
            <QuoteBlock text="Please do what you can, she said." />
            <ContentBlock text="We got to work immediately cleaning top to bottom, removing multiple bags of rubbish, restoring order, and making the space workable for the incoming tradespeople. Once the clean was complete, we sent her another video walkthrough so she could see the transformation for herself. Her response said it all." />
            <ContentBlock text="That first experience built a foundation of trust." />
            <ContentBlock text="After the renovations were complete, she called us back for a post-build clean, and from there, we've continued to support her with regular maintenance cleans, window cleaning, laundry coordination, and anything else her property needs." />
            <ContentBlock text="More recently, she asked us to visit a second property she was renting not just to clean, but to give an honest view on its condition and offer guidance on ongoing issues with the landlord. She knew she could rely on us not just to clean, but to advise." />
            <CalloutBlock text="For Mrs. Dean, we became more than a service, we became her trusted team on the ground." />
