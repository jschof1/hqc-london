          question: "Can you really guarantee turnarounds in just 3-4 hours?",
          answer: "Absolutely. We have dedicated Airbnb teams specifically trained in rapid, hospitality-grade turnarounds. Our average completion time is 2.8 hours for standard properties, with 4-hour maximum for luxury estates. We also maintain backup teams during peak periods and holidays to ensure we never miss your window. In over 2,000 turnovers, we've maintained a 99.8% on-time completion rate."
        },
        {
          question: "How do you ensure the quality matches what luxury guests expect at ¬£350+ per night?",
          answer: "Our team is trained in hospitality standards, not just residential cleaning. We understand that your guests are comparing their experience to luxury hotels. Every turnover includes hotel-standard touches: perfect linen presentation, welcome amenities, strategic lighting, and staging that matches your listing photos. We also provide photo documentation so you can see exactly what guests will encounter."
        },
        {
          question: "What happens if you damage something expensive in my luxury property?",
          answer: "We carry comprehensive insurance specifically for high-value properties up to ¬£50,000 per incident. Our team is trained in luxury furnishing care, from antique furniture to designer fixtures. We also conduct detailed property walkthroughs initially to identify and flag valuable items requiring special care. Any damage is immediately reported, photographed, and resolved through our insurance within 48 hours."
        },
        {
          question: "Can you handle multiple properties and coordinate with my booking calendar?",
          answer: "Yes, we specialize in multi-property portfolio management. We can integrate with your calendar systems, property management software, or coordinate directly with platforms like Airbnb and Booking.com. Our scheduling system allows us to manage complex booking patterns, last-minute changes, and coordinate multiple same-day turnovers across London. Many of our hosts manage 5-15 properties with us seamlessly."
        },
        {
          question: "Is your service reliable during peak seasons and holidays?",
          answer: "Peak seasons are when you need us most, and when we shine. We maintain additional backup teams during Christmas, New Year's, Olympics, and summer peak periods. We also prioritize Airbnb turnovers over standard residential clients during high-demand periods. Our emergency response system means even if something unexpected happens, we can mobilize replacement teams within hours to protect your bookings."
        },
        {
          question: "How much does this premium service cost compared to standard cleaners?",
          answer: "Our turnover service is priced per property based on size and requirements, typically ¬£85-165 per turnover for most London properties. While this costs more than basic cleaners, consider that one negative review about cleanliness can cost you thousands in lost bookings. Our service protects your rating, maximizes your booking potential, and gives you complete peace of mind. Most hosts tell us we pay for ourselves within the first month through improved ratings and reduced stress."
