            answer: "Every team member signs comprehensive NDAs and undergoes background checks before working in professional environments. We establish clear protocols for confidential areas, secure document handling, and locked cabinet procedures. Our teams are trained to work around sensitive meetings and respect privacy requirements. We've successfully served law firms, investment advisors, and consulting practices without a single security incident in over three years."
          },
          {
            question: "Can you really provide the same consistent team, not rotating staff?",
            answer: "Absolutely. Team consistency is fundamental to our boutique approach. We assign dedicated 2-3 person teams to each office who become familiar with your space, schedule, and requirements. This eliminates security concerns, ensures quality consistency, and builds trusted relationships. Our average team retention on office accounts is 18+ months, with many relationships lasting years."
          },
          {
            question: "How flexible are you with our business schedule and urgent needs?",
            answer: "Complete flexibility is what sets us apart from large commercial cleaners. We clean around your business operations - early mornings, evenings, weekends, whatever works for you. For urgent needs like pre-client presentations or emergency situations, we offer same-day response. We understand that business doesn't operate on cleaning company schedules."
          },
          {
            question: "What makes your service different from large commercial cleaning companies?",
            answer: "Large commercial cleaners treat offices like commodity accounts with rotating staff, rigid contracts, and call center communication. We provide boutique attention with dedicated teams, personal relationships, and direct communication. You'll have our founder's personal contact information and deal directly with decision-makers, not account managers or call centers."
          },
          {
            question: "How do you ensure our office always meets executive presentation standards?",
            answer: "We understand that your office is your business card. Our teams are trained in executive presentation standards - from boardroom setup to reception area perfection. We conduct quality checks before leaving and provide photo confirmation for critical client-facing areas. If something isn't right, we return immediately to fix it at no charge."
          },
          {
            question: "What are your rates compared to large commercial cleaning contracts?",
            answer: "Our boutique service is priced according to the value we provide. While large commercial cleaners might quote lower base rates, they add costs for flexibility, emergency response, and quality issues. Our transparent pricing includes dedicated teams, flexible scheduling, emergency response, and direct communication. Most clients find we provide better value through reliability, consistency, and professional image enhancement that impacts their bottom line."
