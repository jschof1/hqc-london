We've personally designed and troubleshot systems for over 20 London wellness centers. We don't just clean your cold plunge - we understand pH balance, filtration flow rates, and how cleaning chemicals affect your system's longevity. Our track record includes preventing thousands in equipment damage that standard cleaners typically cause."
          },
          {
            question: "How do you ensure regulatory compliance for health inspections?",
            answer: "Every WellClean‚Ñ¢ Studio visit includes detailed documentation meeting HSE wellness facility standards. We provide photographic evidence, hygiene audit reports, and compliance checklists specifically formatted for health inspectors. Our protocols are based on medical-grade standards, and we maintain detailed logs of all treatments and products used - giving you complete confidence during inspections."
          },
          {
            question: "Will your cleaning products disrupt the therapeutic atmosphere we've created?",
            answer: "Absolutely not. We use exclusively wellness-grade, aromatherapy-safe products that enhance rather than compete with your therapeutic environment. Our cleaning protocols include subtle scent layering that supports your brand's wellness promise. We understand that your space is carefully curated for healing, and our methods honor that therapeutic intention."
          },
          {
            question: "What happens if there's an emergency or urgent cleaning need?",
            answer: "All WellClean‚Ñ¢ Studio clients receive priority emergency response. Whether it's a cold plunge malfunction, pre-inspection panic, or urgent client-facing issue, we mobilize within hours. Pedro personally handles emergency consultations, and our team is trained to resolve urgent hygiene situations without disrupting your scheduled client sessions."
          },
          {
            question: "How do you handle client privacy and discretion in our wellness environment?",
            answer: "Discretion is fundamental to our service. Our team signs comprehensive NDAs, arrives in unmarked vehicles, and works around your client schedule with minimal disruption. We understand that wellness clients expect complete privacy, and our protocols ensure your therapeutic environment remains serene and confidential. Many of our clients include high-profile individuals who demand absolute discretion."
          },
          {
            question: "Is this service worth the premium investment compared to standard cleaning?",
            answer: "Consider this: One damaged cold plunge filter costs ¬£800-¬£1,500 to replace. A failed health inspection can shut down your business for days. Client complaints about chemical odors or poor hygiene can destroy years of reputation building. Our investment saves you from these costly risks while enhancing your therapeutic brand. Most clients tell us we pay for ourselves within the first month through prevented damage and enhanced client satisfaction."
