We carry comprehensive insurance coverage up to Â£10,000 per garment, and our founder personally oversees the care of any piece worth over Â£500. We've successfully cared for vintage Chanel, bespoke Savile Row suits, and delicate couture pieces without a single damage claim in over three years."

          {
            question: "What makes your service different from premium dry cleaners?",
            answer: "Traditional dry cleaners batch-process garments and use harsh chemicals. We provide individual garment assessment, wellness-grade eco-luxury products, and artisan-level care. Your cashmere never mixes with someone else's gym clothes. Each piece gets personal attention from collection to delivery, with specialized techniques for different fabrics and luxury presentation that makes your clothes look like they've come from Bond Street."

          {
            question: "Is the pickup and delivery service reliable and secure?",
            answer: "Absolutely. We operate on your schedule with confirmed time slots, not vague windows. Our uniformed team arrives in unmarked vehicles, uses secure garment transportation, and requires personal handover or secure key-holding arrangements. We've served diplomats, celebrities, and business leaders who demand absolute reliability and discretion. GPS tracking lets you know exactly when we're arriving."
          },
          {
            question: "Can you handle specialty items like evening gowns, vintage pieces, or bespoke suits?",
            answer: "Specialty garments are our expertise. We've cared for 1960s vintage Dior, hand-beaded evening gowns, military dress uniforms, and Â£5,000+ bespoke suits. Our team includes specialists trained in historical textile care, delicate beadwork, and complex construction details. For truly precious pieces, we offer museum-grade conservation cleaning techniques."
          },
          {
            question: "How do your prices compare to standard laundry services?",
            answer: "We're a premium service for premium wardrobes. While a wash-and-fold app might charge Â£15 for a bag of mixed clothing, we charge based on individual garment care. A bespoke shirt receives Â£8-12 of individual attention, a cashmere jumper gets Â£15-20 of specialist care. Consider that we're extending your garments' lifespan by years while maintaining their pristine condition - we actually save you money long-term by protecting your wardrobe investment."
          },
          {
            question: "What happens if I need something cleaned urgently?",
            answer: "We offer same-day and express services for urgent needs. Whether you need a suit for tomorrow's board meeting or an evening gown for tonight's event, we can mobilize our team. Express service carries a premium, but we've saved countless important occasions by delivering perfectly prepared garments within hours of collection."
