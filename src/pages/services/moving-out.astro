    text: "From packing boxes and coordinating movers to managing paperwork, moving is already one of the most stressful life events. The last thing you want to worry about is scrubbing ovens, disinfecting bathrooms, or making sure the carpets are stain-free. Yet, leaving your old property unclean can mean losing your deposit, getting charged by landlords, or leaving a poor impression on new occupants. Likewise, moving into a space that hasn’t been professionally cleaned means inheriting someone else’s dirt and dust."
