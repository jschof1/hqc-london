            question: "Do you really understand both the technical engineering side and the wellness business side?",
            answer: "This unique combination is exactly what sets our advisory apart. Pedro combines a chemical engineering background with three years of hands-on wellness facility operations experience. He's personally designed, troubleshot, and maintained systems for over 30 London wellness centers. This isn't theoretical knowledge - it's practical expertise from someone who's solved real problems in real facilities, from filtration failures to regulatory compliance challenges."
          },
          {
            question: "How can your consultation prevent expensive equipment failures?",
            answer: "Most wellness equipment failures stem from poor initial design decisions, inadequate maintenance planning, or operational misunderstanding. Our engineering assessment identifies these vulnerabilities before they become problems. For example, we've prevented over ¬£200K in cold plunge system failures by identifying undersized filtration, improper chemical balance systems, and maintenance protocol gaps during the design phase. Prevention is always cheaper than emergency replacement."
          },
          {
            question: "Can you really help with the complex regulatory requirements for wellness facilities?",
            answer: "Wellness facilities face unique HSE requirements that standard consultants don't understand. We provide comprehensive compliance strategies covering everything from air quality standards to chemical storage, emergency protocols to staff safety training. Our clients have a 100% health inspection pass rate because we ensure they understand and exceed all regulatory requirements from day one."
          },
          {
            question: "Is this consultation valuable if my facility is already operational?",
            answer: "Absolutely. Existing facilities often have hidden inefficiencies, safety risks, or compliance gaps that cost money daily. Our operational audits typically identify 15-20 optimization opportunities, from energy savings to maintenance reduction. Most clients see ROI within 60 days through operational improvements alone, not counting prevented failures or compliance issues."
          },
          {
            question: "How do you handle urgent technical problems when systems fail?",
            answer: "All advisory clients receive priority emergency consultation access. Whether it's a cold plunge malfunction, air quality issue, or regulatory emergency, we can provide immediate technical guidance and coordinate expert repairs. Our network includes specialized wellness equipment technicians across London, meaning we can mobilize solutions quickly when every hour of downtime costs you revenue."
          },
          {
            question: "What's the investment for ongoing advisory services after the initial consultation?",
            answer: "Our advisory services are structured to provide exceptional value through prevented problems and operational improvements. Monthly retainers start at ¬£495 for basic technical support, scaling to ¬£1,200+ for comprehensive operational management depending on facility complexity. Most clients find the service pays for itself within weeks through prevented failures, operational efficiencies, and compliance confidence. We're an investment in your business success, not an expense."
