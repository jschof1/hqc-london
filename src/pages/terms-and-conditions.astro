              <p>2.1. The Client must provide:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>safe access to the property at the agreed time</li>

                <li>lack of access</li>
                <li>absence of utilities</li>
                <li>third-party interference</li>
                <li>Client-requested interruptions</li>
              </ul>
              <p>HQC reserves the right to charge for time lost, waiting time, or aborted visits.</p>
              
              <h4 class="font-semibold text-navy mt-6 mb-2">2.3. Inability to Contact Client on Arrival</h4>
              <p>2.3.1. Where HQC attends the property at the agreed time and is unable to contact the Client or their representative, HQC may proceed as follows.</p>
              <p>2.3.2. Where the Services are being provided to a returning Client and access is available, HQC may proceed with the Services in line with the most recent agreed scope or established course of dealing, provided no material changes are apparent.</p>
              <p>2.3.3. Where clarification is required and the Client cannot be contacted, HQC may:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>limit the Services to routine or previously agreed tasks; or</li>
                <li>suspend or abort the visit where proceeding would be unreasonable.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>2.3.4. Where Services cannot reasonably proceed due to lack of instruction or access, the visit may be treated as an aborted visit and charged in accordance with Section 4.</p>
              <p>2.3.5. HQC will make reasonable attempts to contact the Client and will document actions taken.</p>

                <h4 class="font-semibold text-navy mb-2">3.1. Residential Clients</h4>
                <div class="space-y-3">
                  <p>3.1.1. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, payment for residential services is due immediately upon completion of the service, or in advance where required at the time of booking.</p>
                  <p>3.1.2. Where payment is not received by the due date, the account will be considered overdue.</p>
                  <p>3.1.3. HQC reserves the right to suspend or cancel future bookings until all outstanding amounts are paid in full.</p>
                  <p>3.1.4. Where payment remains outstanding, HQC may take reasonable steps to recover the debt, including referral to a third-party recovery agent, and any reasonable recovery costs may be added where permitted by law.</p>

              </div>

              <div>

                <div class="space-y-3">
                  <p>3.2.1. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, payment for commercial services is due in accordance with the agreed invoice terms. Where no terms are stated, payment is due immediately upon receipt of invoice.</p>
                  <p>3.2.2. Where payment is not received by the due date, the account will be considered overdue.</p>
                  <p>3.2.3. HQC reserves the right to charge interest and fixed compensation on overdue amounts in accordance with the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998, including:</p>
                  <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li>interest at 8% above the Bank of England base rate; and</li>

                  </ul>
                  <p>3.2.4. HQC reserves the right to suspend or withhold further services until all outstanding sums are paid in full.</p>

            <div class="space-y-4">
              <p>4.1. A minimum of 48 hours’ notice is required to cancel or reschedule any booking.</p>
              <p>4.2. Where a booking is cancelled or rescheduled with less than 48 hours’ notice, or where:</p>
              <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                <li>cleaners attend and are unable to proceed</li>
                <li>access is refused or unavailable</li>
                <li>conditions prevent safe completion</li>
              </ul>
              <p>the visit may be treated as a late cancellation or aborted visit.</p>

              <h4 class="font-semibold text-navy mt-6 mb-2">4.3. Late Cancellation and Aborted Visits</h4>
              <p>4.3.1. Where a booking is cancelled or rescheduled with less than 48 hours’ notice, HQC may charge a fee equal to the greater of £95 or 50% of the pre-tax service price, capped at the full value of the service.</p>
              <p>4.3.2. This charge represents a genuine estimate of costs already incurred, including staffing allocation, scheduling disruption, travel preparation, and administrative time.</p>
              <p>4.3.3. Any discretion exercised by HQC does not constitute a waiver of this policy for future bookings.</p>

              <h4 class="font-semibold text-navy mt-6 mb-2">4.4. Contracted Services - Cancelled Visits</h4>
              <p>4.4.1. Where services are provided under a contracted or minimum-term agreement, cancellation of individual visits does not suspend or reduce the Client’s payment obligations under the agreement.</p>
              <p>4.4.2. Repeated cancellation of visits may be treated as a material reduction of services and may trigger early termination provisions under Section 10.</p>
