## 🎨 Your Original HTML Pages

Your original HTML pages in the `/pages` folder are preserved and can still be:
- Used as reference
- Served statically if needed
- Gradually migrated to Astro components

## ⚡ Features Working

1. **Tailwind CSS** - All your existing classes work perfectly
2. **Custom Colors** - Your brand colors (gold, navy, ink, mist) are available
3. **Responsive Design** - Mobile-first approach maintained
4. **Font Loading** - Inter and Cormorant Garamond fonts loaded
5. **Icons** - FontAwesome 6.5.1 integrated
6. **Smooth Scrolling** - Anchor link navigation
7. **Form Handling** - Basic form validation ready
8. **Image Optimization** - Astro's built-in optimizations

## 🔧 Next Steps (Optional)

### Add Dynamic Area Pages
```bash
# Your existing area generation script can be adapted
# to generate .astro files instead of .html files
npm run generate:all
```

### Add More Sections to Homepage
The homepage currently has the hero section. You can add more sections by:
1. Reading content from your original `pages/index.html`
2. Converting sections to Astro components
3. Adding them to `src/pages/index.astro`

### Enhance JavaScript Functionality
- Contact forms with validation
- Interactive image galleries
- Advanced animations
- Before/after comparison sliders

## 📋 Migration Notes

- **Asset URLs**: Changed from `assets/` to `/assets/` for Astro compatibility
- **Navigation**: Updated to use Astro routing (`/services` instead of `services.html`)
- **Components**: Split into reusable components for better maintainability
- **Scripts**: Centralized JavaScript in `src/scripts/main.js`

## 🚨 Important

Your **original area generation scripts** in the `/scripts` folder still work and can generate new area pages. The existing workflow is preserved while adding modern Astro capabilities.

## 🎯 Ready to Go!

Your website is now running on modern Astro + Tailwind infrastructure while maintaining all your existing design and functionality. The development server is running and ready for further development!
