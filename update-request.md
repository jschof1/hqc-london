High Quality Clean Ltd - Terms Updates
Hi Jack,

We’ve finalised an updated version of our Terms and Conditions (see below) and need the following changes implemented across the website to ensure consistency, compliance, and clear client consent.

Please treat this as a priority implementation, as these changes directly affect bookings, contracts, and payments.

I will also look at our FAQ wording for that is correct and it aligns to these clauses. I will be sending this next,
