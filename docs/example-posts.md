one of the most underrated ways to build better AI systems: feed them your actual business conversations...

everyone's using generic prompts they found online
meanwhile your slack exports, sales call transcripts & support tickets are sitting there unused

that data contains:
how your customers actually talk
what objections come up repeatedly
the exact language that converts
edge cases you never thought of

i've started doing this for every automation project:
export slack/teams data → feed it to claude → let it learn the business context

suddenly the AI responses sound like they came from someone who's been working there for years

not some generic assistant who learned everything from wikipedia

your business conversations are the most valuable training data you have

stop ignoring them

when you’re rushing mistakes are inevitable

made one recently & honestly… it’s just part of the process

accepted it, learned from it, and apologised where needed

if you’re scared of making mistakes, you’ll never push hard enough to actually learn anything

every mistake over the past year has just taught me how to handle the next situation better so dont be scared otherwise you will neer learn.

imo my adhd brain is actually my biggest blessing

i absolutely hate low leverage tasks & mundane work...

this literally forces me to only focus on the highest leverage moves i can make (growth, creativity, strategy)

i'm always finding ways to automate it, delegate it, or eliminate it completely

the next big move becomes so clear & easy when you eliminate all the noise

always keeping your eye on the prize & taking big swings to move the needle

Productivity is a distorted metric.

Being productive isn’t about working longer and harder. It’s about getting the best work done in the least amount of time possible.

True productivity requires creativity, and long hours suck the time needed to refuel your creative tank.

Work when it's time to work and rest when it's time to rest.

Work is a narrow state of mind while rest is an open state. If your life is dominated by work, you miss out on the ideas and creativity that lead to higher-paying meaningful work. This is why most people are stuck.

Discipline is about getting clear on what you want. Once you know with absolute conviction that you don't want the life that your current habits are leading to, you hate the thought of doing them. Staying the same becomes more painful than pursuing an uncertain goal.

Don't identify with a tool because tools change and get replaced. Identify with what the tools allow you to do: create. That's what you love doing. It doesn't matter if you do it with a paintbrush, camera, Photoshop, or AI. What matters is the vision you bring into reality.

You're probably going to hate me for saying this but appearance matters.

But not in the way but if I had bigger breasts right now you'd like me more.  not that you need to look sexy do you want to get anywhere kind of thing that's not what I'm saying.

I am saying is if you want to make your life more appealing then make it look more beautiful. Make it worth keeping up the appearance.

Think about it, If you had to be so shallow to put things in a box of ugly and beautiful, everything that you like you probably going to put in the beautiful box and everything you don't like you're going to put in the ugly box and yes we're talking shallow levels appearance how it just 'looks' the aesthetic feel of it.

If you thought those things were more beautiful then high chances are that you would use them more often.

So is there something that you think you should be doing more often. Maybe it's brushing, maybe it's cleaning your bedroom more, maybe its remembering to Go to the toilet indoors, not outdoors.

If all these things look more beautiful to you if that toilet was rimmed with a golden line would your cheeks touch it more. Yeah I'm sure the answer is probably.

Chances are if you have a dream that dream probably feels pretty unattainable? I mean come on who the hell has the right to dream We're all just trying to get paid and get by that's it.

Well why don't you stop thinking about that giant dream and simplify and break it down so it does feel painful why don't you imagine the small steps and stop thinking about the big one.

Fitts Law states that if you really want to increase the chances of reaching a specific target then the more obvious it is will correlate to the likeness of hitting the target. So the bigger it is I'm a closer it feels will up your chances.

So next time you think that you're not able to get something done or that your dream is too big then bear this in mind

And apply it to all of your life, have you got a business you run with a website, What's the target of that site? If you want people to call you then make that button bigger and make it more obvious set the goal and make it easily attainable for the user and then maybe the [loop]

anyone else suffer from tab ovearload and mindless browsing?
here is how you stop it:
- Setting rules,
- Making pins/bookmarks
- Changing layout


Layout:
One important things you just don't want your tabs to get lost you don't delete it because you don't know what it is so you keep it not really knowing why it's there but not wanting to delete it. It's our classic hoarder mentality, one forever haunts me in every area of my life. Thanks capitalism you've made me a total consumption whore. To stop this consumption what we can do is find a way to put your tabs on the right side or the left side of your page instead of the top this means that at least you can read what those tabs are you can say right okay this is an article about something I shouldn't be reading so I will delete it and I don't like it so I'm not going to keep it. Just having at least a visibility of knowing what it is we'll make a massive difference.

Setting rules:
Ok I'm kind of lying here because I can't really follow rules so I don't really set them I just make it way too hard for my lazy self too break the rule. So the rule that I would set is before you open a new tab is there a tab that you can currently change and serve on there. If you always ask yourself this then there's a high chance you'll see your use of tabs reduce significantly. The more nerdy and tacky way I do this which I really recommend is based on the hotkeys that you use on your computer. If you don't use them I really recommend that you start using them. Your life will speed up seriously fast. Anywho by pressing command + t we open a new tab. That's the normal way to do. This is the biggest and most dangerous hockey that has played my life. Get rid of it. Change it for something else. For instance you could change command + t to just focus on your current window and then do your search there. And then set a route to yourself if I genuinely need the current tab I'm on and so I'm going to create a new one then you must bookmark it and then place it elsewhere or pin it if you think it really has to be seen soon and you will forget it. It just makes sure you stop this ease of opening new tabs all the time without having a process for what you're going to do with the one that you're on.

Pins:
And then now this follows with the idea of pins and bookmarks. And the real hard bit knowing what to hold and what is just hoarding. This is a skill in the age of information, and information where everything is just so shiny, so tasty and so consumable mmmmm, if there is anything you take away from what I am saying this is the most important thing that you learn and your browser is the best place to learn it. Learn what to cull, learn what to remove, learn what is useful and what is it. This is where said you need to ask these questions that you must ask whenever you look at a piece of information.

Your business has a story. But are you telling it well?

Creating content online isn't just pushing ads. It's your dojo for mastering that story. It's where you experiment with the narrative, see which chapters your audience leans into, and which parts need a rewrite.

The goal? Not just likes, but genuine understanding and connection.

Some of my biggest decisions in life is when I decided to just go somewhere on my own and to have a 'moment' - and by moment what I mean is getting the fuck away from whatever the hell you're doing and thinking about what you're doing in the first place

People care about their problem, not your pitch. Focus on helping people first. Show that you genuinely care and that you're passionate about what you do. Share tips, fixes, and give free advice without any strings. It’s surprising how quickly that genuine kindness turns strangers into clients.

Your landing page isn’t broken — it’s trying to do too much too soon.
You overwhelm visitors before they understand what you offer.
Flashy headlines and colourful buttons won’t help if they can’t feel their problem.
In four seconds, show them the pain and your solution.
Only then talk features, pricing or demos.
Strip back the extras and start with a pain they recognise.
Impress them with clear copy first: the pitch, the problem you solve and how, rather than flashy animations that say nothing.

This running your own bussiness thing can be a total pain in the ass You want to be an entrepreneur you want to run your own business you want to start your own thing you want to focus on your passion. Why does it have to be so complicated just for me to not have to file my head down to someone else wants me to do and decide to do something I love and care about. It feels like it's an uphill battle. You get word of mouth you get this excitement things are working out things are happening and then things start to slow down. Then some asshole young person is telling you you need to get on social media you need to get a website. The fact is that asshole isn't talking too much rubbish. In fact I think that asshole kind of knows what they're talking about. And yeah I am one of those assholes. I no I often don't have a clue what I'm talking about. But I do know one thing very clearly, all this internet malarkey, all this social media posting nightmare, put in your face as the front and centre of your business, it's just the way the world is. And it can be a huge benefit sometimes. There are less glass ceilings. Because all it takes for you to showcase your professionalism isn't by having to buy a shop window, for having a funny little uniform and a cool logo, now if it literally just be you speaking to a camera, talking about your passion and your knowledge. And it sounds daunting you need to ignore the likes and the followers and the shares, you need to ignore the fact that the word SEO sounds like hell and the website to you is just some sort of boring business brochure. Because the truth is is that all of these things are the answer to automating the boring things so you can focus on your craft, all it takes is a website that works and a system that was comfortable for you to articulate your expertise and your passion for what you do. That's all it takes to your life to simplify. These tools and technologies are not there to make you feel stupid or like the rest of the world's mad these tools and technologies are there to make your life easier and hopefully make you money. The fact is the more you use them the more you understand them and the more you try to adapt do this horrible of online presence the more you'll soon realise how just showing your passion and your craft could take your business and your voice to a place which you never thought would be better there are millions people are listening and the world becomes your oyster

Keywords aren't SEO wizardry. They're just what real people type when they need help.

If your site doesn’t use their words, Google doesn’t show your site. Simple as that.

Most sites lose the visitor in the first 5 seconds.
Why?
Because the headline talks about the business — not the buyer.

Here are 10 headline templates that actually make people stay, scroll, and click.

Here is what is wrong with your current copy:

Overly persuasive: Uses pressure tactics, exaggerated claims, or emotional manipulation.

Inauthentic tone: Feels scripted, insincere, or like it's prioritising a sale over a relationship.

Buzzword-heavy: Filled with clichés or marketing jargon instead of plain, grounded language.

Lacks substance: Prioritises style over clarity, skipping over details that matter to the buyer.

Self-serving: More about pushing a product or service than solving the customer’s actual problem.

Energetic without trust: Tries too hard to excite or impress rather than build trust or understanding.


Would you say you’re trying to steer your tone more towards calm authority and genuine support?

People do not buy from businesses they do not trust. Simple as that.

And trust? It starts the second someone lands on your site. If your website looks outdated, messy, or just off, visitors will bounce. And once they are gone, they are not coming back.

Here is the reality—92 percent of people read reviews before making a decision. That means nearly everyone is looking for proof that you are legit before they even consider working with you.

So how do you build trust? Social proof. Do not just say people love working with you—show it. Real testimonials. Real names. Real results. If you have worked with brands people recognize, put them front and center. If customers are raving about you, make sure new visitors see it.

I see it all the time. A business with great services but a website that makes them look sketchy. No reviews, no credibility signals, just a generic “We are the best” statement. But when they add testimonials, case studies, and clear proof of results, suddenly, customers start saying yes.

And make sure your site backs it up. A messy layout, blurry images, or clunky design instantly make you look less credible. A clean, well-structured site makes everything feel more legit.

Trust is what turns visitors into customers. Make your website feel credible, make it feel human, and give people a reason to believe in what you do. Because when they trust you, they buy from you.

Everyday, i get exposed to at least a source of negativity:

some dudes online bashing my startup
rejections from different orgs / individuals
some girl i dated said i'm not doing enough
my partners trying to take advantage of me
some mentors/idols i like bashing my directions
friends who "blocked" me bc my path annoys them
and more

It hurts, a lot, when you just know that someone you thought you could trust, is no longer on your side.

When you put yourself out there, and start screaming about what you want to do in life, it is unavoidable that your fire will raise some, if not many, eyebrows

I've realized that it is particularly dangerous to let those negativity accumulates in me

Eventually, they will leak:

to my products
to people i support
to people supporting me

I have spent weeks/months/years in depression just because someone I thought important suddenly "abandoned" me.

Enough to remind myself that:

If sb don't support you, don't try to change their mind or dizz them.

Try to respond with kindness, humility, or at the very least, silence.

Hate is unhealthy, un-productive, and distracting, especially when you have a burning goal to reach.

Embrace disapprovals, even from those close to you, with a light and humble heart.

Treat them like falling leaves along your path. Let them fade away from your main journey

The world has 8 billion people.

And if you are in your 20s - most people who will support, love, ally with you, haven't even shown up in your life yet.

So there's no point in being bogged down in some past relationships who see you as not deserving their presence.

Am I doing it well? By all means no.

But I am trying to be better every single day.

And I welcome those daily dose of negativity with open arms.
